# Chrome Extensions
This is collections of some cool extensions which I thought would be useful for me. I have been using them frequently. You can use them too.

## How to install one
I have not published them anywhere so you can get them from here only. It is really simple to use them.
1. Download the .crx file from extension folder.
2. Go to extension page of your chrome.
3. Drag your downloaded .crx file on extension settings page of chrome.
4. There must be a popup to ask to whether you want to add it or not. Click on add and you are good to go.
